waypoint

Will need a webserver to run because I tried using QUnit for the first time and tried running that in the browser.

Usage: Clone repo into SOME_DIR. Then run webserver with document root set to SOME_DIR.

Run tests http://your.webserver.example.com/test

Run waypoint http://your.webserver.example.com/src Do not that this will not work without a Google Maps API key for Google Maps Javascript API & Google Maps DistanceMatrix Service.
